 # Multilinear Regression on Red Wine Dataset 🍷

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multilinear Regression** using the **Red Wine Quality dataset**.  
The goal is to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and the target variable using statistical and machine learning techniques.
 
--- 

## 📊 Dataset Description
The Red Wine dataset contains multiple physicochemical features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH level, and other attributes that influence wine quality.  
Since the dataset contains **two or more independent variables**, it is suitable for **multilinear regression analysis**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
The following EDA steps were performed: 
- Basic data inspection and summary statistics 
- Handling missing values (if any) 
- Data visualization using:
  - Pair plots
  - Heatmaps 
  - Correlation analysis to understand feature relationships
 
--- 

## 🛠 Feature Engineering
- Separated **features (X)** and **target variable (y)**
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets**
- Prepared data for model training

---

## 📐 Multilinear Regression Model
Multilinear Regression is applied when multiple independent variables are used to predict a dependent variable.

### Regression Formula:

- Calculated **coefficients** for each feature
- Identified the **intercept**
- Trained the regression model using training data

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **R-squared (R²):** 35%
- **Adjusted R-squared:** 33%

### Error Metrics Used:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics help measure how well the model predicts the target variable.

## 📑 OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Summary
As the final step, **OLS regression analysis** was performed to:
- Validate coefficient significance
- Analyze p-values
- Interpret statistical relationships between variables

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project provides a complete understanding of:
- Multilinear regression concepts
- Statistical interpretation using OLS
- Model evaluation using regression metrics

It serves as a solid foundation for supervised learning and regression-based problems.
